h1. A simple and clean theme for Froxlor.

"Froxlor":http://www.froxlor.org/ is a multilingual server-management-panel for Internet service providers (ISP), which want to offer a webinterface for their customers for managing e-mail-addresses, domains, FTP and more.

The default Themes of Froxlor looks boring. Therefore, I have create a fresh theme based on "Twitter Bootstrap":http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/. Note: This Theme is early Beta!
